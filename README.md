# Boole and the Boulders

This game was made for [LM0B Beginners Game Jam #28](https://itch.io/jam/lm0b-beginners-game-jam-28) by @skandoa (design, art, sound) and me (code, design).

> This is the end of the world. Boulders are falling from the sky and Boole the frog wants to live.  
> Move Boole with the arrow keys. Avoid the falling boulders.
